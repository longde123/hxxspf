HXXSPF
======
Haxe implementation of XSPF ("spiff"), the XML format for sharing playlists.  
http://xspf.org/  

It is free and open -- No proprietary lock-in.  
It is portable -- You should be able to send a playlist to your friend and have it work.  
It is well-engineered -- Most playlist formats get the easy things wrong.  

Unlike M3U, XSPF is XML.  
Unlike SMIL, XSPF is simple.  
Unlike ASX, XSPF is open.
